GIT HUB tutorials for me.

FOR WINDOWS
Downloading Instructions.
1. Download Git for Windows.
2. For Windows, we might be asked to update or install dot.net framework. Just do it.

Once the download is over. We will have a git hub prompt (Not windows prompt).

1. Create a repository as shown here and start commiting files as shown here.
	https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo
	
2. But in place of
	a. git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git
	USE git remote add github https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git
	
	b. 	git push origin master
	USE git push github master
	
So the line a. is used only once.
But line b. is used everytime we commit.

So the process of commiting is same as that of svn.
add, commit and push.
