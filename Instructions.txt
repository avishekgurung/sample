Error 1. Github “fatal: remote origin already exists”

Sol. You can add the remote repository with a different name, for example github instead of origin (which obviously already exists in your system), like this:
git remote add github git@github.com:ppreyer/first_app.git
Remember though, everywhere in the tutorial you see 'origin' you should replace it with 'github'. For example git push origin master should now be git push github master.
However, if you want to see what that origin which already exists is, you can do a git remote -v. If you think this is there by some error, you can remove it and add the proper one by doing this:
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:ppreyer/first_app.git
